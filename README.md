R scripts to process PyRAD outputs for DAPC and bpp analyses
the codes are project specific. 
Modifying the codes reguires basic knowledge about using regular expression in R

three scripts included.
1. to subset struture file. The struture file output from PyRAD requires some manual editing before it can be used for subsetting.
2. to creat a bpp loci input file from the .loci output of PyRAD.
3. to subset the loci input file of bpp. You can randomly choose the number of loci to creat a new bpp loci txt. You can also calculate the number of segregating sites for each of the locus and based on this information to choose loci for bpp analyses.
